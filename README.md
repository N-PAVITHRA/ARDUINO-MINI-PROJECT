# TINKERCAD-MINI-PROJECT
Arduino mini projects using Tinkercad Simulation Tool

# SMART GATE SYSTEM
Objective:

 To create a Smart Gate System(Automatic opening and closing gate) using Tinkercad.
When a person comes near to the gate, it open automatically at a particular angle and closes when the person leaves. 

Components:
1. Arduino Uno R3
2. Positional Micro Servo
3. Ultrasonic Distance Sensor

Application:
1. Used in malls or shopping complex.
2. Used in big companies where large employees work.
